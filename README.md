# Base Repositories

Our work aims to derive and build on top of the two projects:
- Text2LIVE: https://text2live.github.io/ ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02491))
- DreamFusion3D: https://dreamfusion3d.github.io/ ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14988))

Hence, this directory contains a copy of the base repositories for the above.
- Text2LIVE has an open source official implementation: https://github.com/omerbt/Text2LIVE
- DreamFusion3D has an open source unofficial implementation with open-source modifications including replacement of [Imagen](https://imagen.research.google/) by [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion): https://github.com/ashawkey/stable-dreamfusion
